A minimalist blog for plant enthusiasts, built to practice and showcase styling with Tailwind CSS. This project features a clean, responsive design with a focus on sharing plant-related content.

## Features

- **Tailwind CSS Utility-First Styling:** Demonstrates the practical application of Tailwind's utility classes for rapid and consistent styling.
- **Themed Blog Posts:** Includes example blog post cards with images, author information, titles, short descriptions, and a like counter.
- **Custom Typography:** Utilizes "Montserrat" for headings and navigation, and "Source Serif Pro" for body text, enhancing the visual hierarchy.
- **SVG Icons:** Incorporates a custom plant logo and like icons as SVG for scalability and visual appeal.
- **Newsletter Subscription:** Features a basic newsletter signup form in the footer.

## Getting Started

To view this project in your local environment:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your_repository_url>
    ```

    _(Replace `<your_repository_url>` with the actual URL of your repository)_

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd plant-blog
    ```

3.  **Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.**

    Since this project primarily uses client-side technologies (HTML and Tailwind CSS via CDN), you do not need a server to run it.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For structuring the content and layout of the blog.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework (included via CDN) for styling the user interface.
- **Google Fonts:** For providing the "Montserrat" and "Source Serif Pro" font families.
- **SVG:** For the plant logo and other icons.

## Assets

The project includes the following assets:

- `./assets/icons/favicon.svg`: Favicon for the browser tab.
- `./assets/img/`: Directory containing images for the blog post cards and author profiles.

## Potential Future Enhancements

- Implementing actual blog post pages with full content.
- Adding more blog post cards dynamically.
- Improving the newsletter signup functionality with backend integration.
